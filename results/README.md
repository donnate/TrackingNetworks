# TrackingNetworks: Results



Auxiliary folder to process and store results if needed. The file __plot_results_from_R.py__ provides a way of plotting the results obtained (via R implementation) with seaborn and matplotlib (since python provides perhaps easier visualization tools). The folder __final_dist__ can be used to store results that can then be visualized and analyzed with __plot_results_from_R.py__ .
